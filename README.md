# mail-server-system
my own simple mail sending service.

the system was neccesary because:

1:great backup when you cant remember your logins and need to 
send an email to a loved one or business partner urgently.

2:great idea when you dont want to share your logins with other people.
        
Updates:

#sends mail from a varied email adress to a varied email adress.
	
#Now a confirmation message from the developer is available if email is sent to the recepient.
#You can write the subject of the email
.
//this idea was inspired by a real life problem
	.
in case you have a suggestion or maybe a question send me an email (astianseb730@gmail.com)
